# Minesweeper
Develop Minesweeper in Java  
Please see the release notes for details.

## Release Note
https://github.com/jellyfish26/Minesweeper/releases

## Make it work
Because this program uses JavaFX, it does not work with Open JDK in Java 11 or later.  
However, since there is Openjfx, it can be used by installing it.  
Also, when operating with Gradle it will do everything up to loading openjfx so you do not need to do anything.


## Development environment
Arch linux (kernel:4.20.0)  
OpenJDK 11.0.1 2018-10-16  
Gradle 5.0 (Gradle wrapper)
